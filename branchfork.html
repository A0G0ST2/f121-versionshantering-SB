        <h1>What is a branch? What is a fork?</h1>

        <p>Branching and forking provide two ways of diverging from the main code line. Both Mercurial and Git have the
            concept of branches at the local level. A repository code branch, like a branch of a tree, remains part of
            the
            original repository. The code that is branched (main trunk) and the branch know and rely on each other. Like
            a
            tree trunk's branch, a code branch knows about the trunk (original code base) it originated from.
        </p>

        <p>Fork is another way of saying clone or copy. The term fork (in programming) derives from an Unix system call
            that
            creates a copy of an existing process. So, unlike a branch, a fork is independent from the original
            repository.
            If the original repository is deleted, the fork remains. If you fork a repository, you get that repository
            and
            all of its branches.</p>

        <p>As DVCS hosting evolved, the term fork evolved. The Bitbucket software adds management to forks; forking a
            repository in Bitbucket has functionality you normally wouldn't associate with a simple DVCS clone. For
            example,
            on Bitbucket, you can always see which repository the fork came from. This isn't the case with a DVCS clone
            on
            your local system.</p>
